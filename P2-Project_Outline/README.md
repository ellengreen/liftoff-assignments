# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will be a sort of "collector's guide" for the game Animal Crossing New Horizons. In the game, your character catches fish, bugs, and collects fossils around an island. These items have varying rarity, availability windows, and selling prices. While playing the game, it only shows you (limited) information on fish, bugs, and fossils that have only already been found. 

My app will allow the user to keep track of which items they have already collected and see their completion progress, as well as allow them to see what critters are currently available to catch, along with a more comprehensive data profile. 
### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application. 

Add to Collection: When logged in, users will be able to add items to their respective collection

Search: Users will be able to search for items (bugs, fish, fossils, villagers) containing given text. 
### Technologies
Angular
JavaScript
MongoDB
Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to connect my project to a database, likely MongoDB. All of the data will be coming from a public API, so I will need to learn how to work with the incoming JSON.
